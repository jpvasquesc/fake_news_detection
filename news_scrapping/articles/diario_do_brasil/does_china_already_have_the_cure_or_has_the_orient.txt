Does China already have the cure or has the ORIENTAL DNA been spared the Great Reset?

The virus that does not like Chinese …
Analyzing the number of deaths that occurred due to the Chinese virus, it is possible to notice the stark difference between the first ones on the list and the country where the virus appeared.
Note in the following sequence that the USA (584,226 deaths), BrasiI (383,757 deaths), Mexico (214,095 deaths), India (186,928 deaths), the United Kingdom (127,345 deaths), Italy (118,357 deaths) and France (102,164 deaths) lead ( respectively) the absolute ranking of fatalities victims originated from the Chinese virus … while China appears in the position nº 57, with 4636 cases of deaths.
How can a virus spread quickly (and fatally) in some countries and not in others?
Does China already have a cure (due to the low number of fatalities and the non-proliferation of the virus)?
Was Covid-19 meticulously created so as not to reproduce in Chinese and / or Oriental DNA?
Will the communist country be hiding the real number of fatalities?
